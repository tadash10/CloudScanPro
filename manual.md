Introduction

This manual provides instructions on how to use the Cloud Infrastructure Security Scan and Vulnerability Assessment script to automate security scans and vulnerability assessments across multiple cloud platforms with centralized reporting and risk assessment. The script is compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 standards for information security.
Requirements

The following software is required to run the script:

    Python 3.6 or higher
    Boto3 library for AWS API access
    Google Cloud SDK for GCP API access
    Requests library for HTTP requests
    JSON library for parsing API responses

Installation

    Install Python 3.6 or higher if it is not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Install the required libraries by running the following command in the terminal:

pip install boto3 google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 requests

    Download the script from the GitHub repository or clone it using Git:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-security-scan.git

    Set up credentials for AWS and GCP. See the following links for more information on how to set up credentials:
